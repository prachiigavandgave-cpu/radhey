<h2>Radha & Krishna – Love Beyond Time</h2>

<p>
Radha and Krishna did not need marriage to prove their love.
Their bond was not limited by society, rituals, or distance.
It was a promise made by souls — not words.
</p>

<p>
Krishna belonged to the world, yet Radha lived in his heart.
Radha belonged to devotion, yet Krishna breathed in her silence.
They met less, waited more, and loved endlessly.
</p>

<p>
Their love teaches us that true love is patience,
faith, trust, and choosing each other even when life pulls apart.
